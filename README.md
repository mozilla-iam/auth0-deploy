# auth0-rules

[Auth0 Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) used by the Mozilla IAM SSO system.
You can find more information about Auth0 at https://www.auth0.com

The rules are snippets of javascript code running as [webtasks](https://www.webtask.io), which modify the authentication flow of users in Auth0.

## Branches

`master`:
The master branch is used for development of rules and are auto-deployed on https://manage-dev.mozilla.auth0.com/

`production`:
/!\ The production branch is used for deployments to the production Auth0 tenant. Deployment from the production branch to the production tenant is triggered by a manual execution of a CodeBuild job

## Deployment & CI

Rules are deployed with `auth0-ci` <https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-ci> after CI has completed.
For testing, this looks like this:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ uploader_rules.py <args>
```

## Development

How do I know which nodejs modules are available to me?

As of July 2021 [the production tenant of Auth0 runs node v8.17.0](https://manage.mozilla.auth0.com/dashboard/pi/auth/tenant/advanced).
The module list that is cached inside webtasks is listed here:
https://auth0-extensions.github.io/canirequire/

### Style

The primary goal is to follow the style of the [Auth0 example rules](https://github.com/auth0/rules/tree/master/src/rules).
This appears to follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
in some ways as there are trailing semi-colon characters. In other ways the 
Auth0 rules do not follow the Google style as some contain [`var` declarations](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#features-use-const-and-let)
Try to follow the Google style in the Mozilla rules in this repo.

### Development cycle

This is the cycle today. In the future we hopefully add CI driven tests. 
This cycle could be improved.

Please note that for any large change (i.e. anything but a single rule change), it is recommended to backup the current rules before deploying. You can do this by following the run-book at https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SECURITY/Create+and+reload+auth0+rules+backup

#### 1 Manual development deployment and testing

1. Confirm that the head of `master` contains the same code as is live in `auth0-dev`
   by doing a diff.
   1. Ensure you've checked out `auth0-ci`, [created and activated a virtualenv](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-ci#virtual-environment)
      and [have a `credentials.json` file with valid credentials](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-ci#credentials)
   2. Ensure your local copy of `auth0-deploy` is up to date and on `master`
   3. Run `uploader_rules.py` on the `auth0-deploy` rule directory
      `./uploader_rules.py --dry-run --rules-dir ../auth0-deploy/rules`
   4. Confirm that no differences are detected between your local code and what's
      live in `auth-dev`
2. Create a branch to work in in your local repo
3. Write a rule in your local branch of the repo
4. Run `uploader_rules.py -r rules` to deploy the uncommitted rule to `auth0-dev`
5. Do manual testing in `auth0-dev` to determine if the rule does what you want
6. Iterate steps 1-3 until you have a rule that works
7. Remove the new rule from `auth0-dev`. This could be done by checking out 
   master (which doesn't have the rule) and again running `uploader_rules.py -r rules`

#### 2 Commit your changes and deploy to auth-dev with CI

1. Push your branch to your fork and create a PR with your new rule, requesting 
   a review of the PR.
2. Someone reviews the PR, either suggesting changes or approving
3. Merge the PR to `master`
4. CI deploys the PR to `auth0-dev`
   * This CI runs in AWS CodeBuild in the `mozilla-iam` (320464205386) AWS
     account in the `us-west-2` region in the AWS CodeBuild project
     `auth0-deploy-stage`.
   * The CodeBuild project follows the [`buildspec.yml`](buildspec.yml) which
     calls the [`Makefile`](Makefile) which calls the 
     [`uploader_rules.py`](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-ci/blob/master/uploader_rules.py)
     tool which is installed from the [`auth0-ci`](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-ci)
     project.
5. Manually test again in `auth0-dev` to validate that the rule works. This is 
    the stage to do more thorough testing as this is the last step before
    production deployment

#### 3 PR to `production` and deploy to prod

1. If you're unsure if manual changes have been made in the production rules in
   Auth0, you do the same kind of comparison we did in dev.
   1. Checkout the `production` branch in your local repo
   2. Run `uploader_rules.py` on the `auth0-deploy` rule directory
      `./uploader_rules.py --dry-run --rules-dir ../auth0-deploy/rules`
   3. Confirm that no differences are detected between your local code and what's
      live in production Auth0
2. Switch back to the `master` branch
3. If testing validated that your new or changed rule is good, [create a second PR from `master` to `production`](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/auth0-deploy/compare/production...master),
    requesting review and referencing, in the text of the PR, the
    first PR which contains the initial review. Ideally the changes in the first
    dev PR and this prod PR will be the same and the reviewer can leverage
    the dev PR's review. If that's not the case a new thorough review would be
    needed.
4. During change window, merge the PR. Now you have to manually run the 
   CodeBuild job `auth0-deploy-prod` which will deploy the rules to the Auth0 
   production tenant. You can do this using the AWS cli running 
   `aws codebuild start-build --project-name auth0-deploy-prod`, or using the 
   AWS UI console navigating to CodeBuild, choosing `auth0-deploy-prod`, 
   pressing `Start build` and pressing again `Start build` in the next screen. 
   Once the job finish successfully, all the rules should be uploaded to Auth0 
   prod.
5. [Test in prod](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SECURITY/Auth0+manual+testing) 
   to make sure everything works and rollback if it doesn't.  

##### What if the CodeBuild fails?

`HTTP 409 Conflict` means that the unique ordering ID stored in a new rule's .json file is not unique across all .json files. Alter the ordering ID in the new rule's .json and try again.

## Testing

Test are run by GitHub actions on every Pull Request.
To run the tests locally, first setup your testing environment.

This is a one time step

* `cd tests`
* `npm install`

Next run the tests

* `cd tests`
* `npm run tests` 

## Known Issues

### Auth0 Rule Web UI jshint configuration

The Auth0 web UI where you can view and modify rules, for example at
https://manage-dev.mozilla.auth0.com/dashboard/pi/auth-dev/rules
has a jshint built in which isn't aware that Auth0 rules are run under
Node version `8.17.0` and as a result shows errors for things like
`require` and `let`. To work around this add this to the top of your rule

```
/*jshint esversion: 6 */
```

### Auth0 Rule Web UI save button

The Auth0 web UI where you can view and modify rules, for example at
https://manage-dev.mozilla.auth0.com/dashboard/pi/auth-dev/rules
when you click the `Save` button, a green banner saying
`The rule script has been saved` shows up. The content however won't
always be saved and the `Save` button won't always turn from blue to
gray. If waiting on the page for the async save to complete isn't working
you can click the `Save` button a second time.
